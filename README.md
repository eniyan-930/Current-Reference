# Current-Reference

This project was developed for the Analog Design Hackathon (2025) Organaised by CDAC Bengaluru. The objective of this design is to develop a bandgap current reference circuit that maintains a stable output current across a wide temperature range, from -40°C to 125°C, with low power consumption and excellent load regulation.

The Circuit is designed on a 90nm CMOS process using Synopsys Custom Compiler.

 ## Specifications
 - **Output Current:** 100µA with a variation of ±5%.
 - **Power Supply:** 1.8V to 3.3V.
 - **Power Consumption:** Less than 50µW.
 - **Temperature Coffecient of Output:** Less than 50ppm/°C.
 - **Load Regulation:** Output current should remain stable within 2% when the load voltage varies from 0 to 1V.
